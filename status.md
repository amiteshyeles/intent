## Current Focus
Core reflection flow is now fully functional with polished UI! The app can successfully:
- Add apps to reflection list (popular apps + custom apps with visual indicators)
- Full-screen modal app management with search, multi-select, and batch operations
- Show countdown timer with breathing animation
- Display contextual reflection questions
- Handle bypass flow
- Show post-reflection confirmation with productive alternatives
- Track reflection sessions and question effectiveness
- Floating modal for custom app creation with proper spacing and shadows
- Native iOS experience with compact, dense design

## Next Steps
1. Add deep linking support for iOS Shortcuts integration
2. Implement AppListItem component for better dashboard UI
3. Complete Settings screen with global settings management
4. Add Onboarding screen for first-time users
5. Implement ShortcutService for iOS Shortcuts generation
6. Add AppSettingsScreen for per-app configuration

## Issues Encountered
- ✅ TypeScript module resolution errors (FIXED - updated tsconfig.json)
- ✅ AsyncStorage import issues (FIXED - converted to MMKV, then reverted to AsyncStorage)
- ✅ MMKV compatibility issues (FIXED - reverted to AsyncStorage due to TurboModules requirement)
- ✅ Linter JSX errors (FIXED - added jsx configuration)
- ✅ Custom badge alignment issues (FIXED - removed flex:1 from app name)
