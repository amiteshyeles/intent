## Current Focus
Core reflection flow is now fully functional with polished UI! The app can successfully:
- Add apps to reflection list (popular apps + custom apps with visual indicators)
- Full-screen modal app management with search, multi-select, and batch operations
- Show countdown timer with breathing animation
- Display contextual reflection questions
- Handle bypass flow
- Show post-reflection confirmation with productive alternatives
- Track reflection sessions and question effectiveness
- Floating modal for custom app creation with proper spacing and shadows
- Native iOS experience with compact, dense design

## ✅ Blocking Mechanism Implemented!
**The app now has complete blocking functionality!** 
- Deep link handling: `intentional://reflect?app=instagram` triggers reflection flow
- ShortcutService: Generates iOS shortcuts to replace app icons
- Onboarding flow: Guides users through shortcut setup
- Test functionality: Dashboard has test button to verify deep links work

**How it works:** User taps custom shortcut → Opens our app with deep link → Shows reflection → Opens target app

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **📱 Complete Settings Screen** - Global settings management and app configuration
2. **⚙️ Add AppSettingsScreen** - Per-app configuration (delay time, question types, etc.)
3. **🎯 Enhanced Onboarding Screen** - Complete guided setup flow for first-time users
4. **📊 Add Analytics Service** - Track reflection completion rates and effectiveness
5. **🔄 Enhanced Productive Alternatives** - Smart recommendations based on time/context
6. **🎨 UI Polish** - Final animations, transitions, and micro-interactions
7. **🧪 Testing & Bug Fixes** - Comprehensive testing of all flows

## ✅ Implementation Complete
**The app now works as intended:**
- ✅ Deep link handling: `intentional://reflect?app={appId}` → ReflectionScreen
- ✅ iOS Shortcuts generation: ShortcutService creates shortcuts for home screen placement
- ✅ Shortcut flow: Custom shortcut → Our app → Reflection → Target app
- ✅ Basic onboarding: ShortcutService provides setup instructions and flows
- ✅ App scheme configured: `intentional://` URL scheme registered
- ✅ Test functionality: Dashboard test button to verify deep links work

**Key Features Working:**
- Users can create shortcuts for any added app via the share button in AppListItem
- Deep links properly navigate to ReflectionScreen with correct app context
- Reflection flow leads to PostReflectionScreen with target app launch
- Complete blocking mechanism implemented using iOS Shortcuts + deep links

## Issues Encountered
- ✅ TypeScript module resolution errors (FIXED - updated tsconfig.json)
- ✅ AsyncStorage import issues (FIXED - converted to MMKV, then reverted to AsyncStorage)
- ✅ MMKV compatibility issues (FIXED - reverted to AsyncStorage due to TurboModules requirement)
- ✅ Linter JSX errors (FIXED - added jsx configuration)
- ✅ Custom badge alignment issues (FIXED - removed flex:1 from app name)
