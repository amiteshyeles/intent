# üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Intentional App Launcher ‚Äî Product Spec (MVP)

## Overview

This is a mobile app (iOS-first, built with Expo) designed to help users pause before opening distracting apps. By introducing a 60-second delay and reflective questions, the app encourages mindful usage and breaks habitual dopamine-seeking behavior.

## Goals

- Interrupt mindless app launches with intentional friction
- Help users reflect on their usage purpose
- Offer a graceful, configurable bypass mechanism
- Focus on simplicity and iOS compatibility

---

## Target Platform

- **iOS** (initial focus, via Shortcuts workaround)
- **Built with:** Expo (React Native)

---

## Core Features

### 1. App Dashboard (Main Screen)
- View list of apps configured for intentional launching
- Toggle reflection on/off per app
- View/edit delay time per app
- Open app-specific settings

#### Example Entry:
```
[‚úì] Instagram         Delay: 60s      [‚öôÔ∏è Settings]
[ ] TikTok            Delay: ‚Äî        [‚öôÔ∏è]
[+] Add App
```

---

### 2. Add App Flow
- Choose from list of popular apps (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc.)
- Optionally add custom app with:
  - App name
  - App icon (optional)
  - Deep link (e.g., `instagram://`)
- Save configuration and show how to install Shortcut

---

### 3. Reflection Flow (Triggered from Shortcut)
- 60-second delay screen:
  - Shows question: ‚ÄúWhy are you opening this app?‚Äù
  - Countdown timer
  - Optional bypass: ‚ÄúProceed With Intention‚Äù

#### Bypass Flow:
1. ‚ÄúDo you have a specific purpose?‚Äù
   - If no: return to home screen
   - If yes:
2. ‚ÄúSay your purpose out loud‚Äù (UI hint). "Type it here (we don't store it)"
3. ‚ÄúHow long will it take?‚Äù ‚Üí user picks time
4. Launch target app
5. (Optional) local timer to remind user when time is up

---

### 4. Global Settings
- Set global default delay time
- Batch toggle intentional mode for all apps
- Global toggle: "Disable for 1 hour"

---

### 5. Shortcut Generation (iOS-only)
- Preconfigured iCloud Shortcut for each added app
- Setup instructions:
  - ‚ÄúTap to install Shortcut‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúAdd to Home Screen‚Äù
  - Optional: hide original app icon

---

## Data Model

```ts
AppConfig {
  id: string
  name: string
  icon: string
  deepLink: string
  isEnabled: boolean
  delaySeconds: number
  allowBypass: boolean
  questionsType: 'default' | 'gratitude' | 'custom'
}
GlobalSettings {
  defaultDelay: number
  enableAll: boolean
}
```

Stored via `AsyncStorage` or `MMKV`.

---

## Not in MVP (But Planned Later)
- Android foreground app detection (requires ejection)
- Cloud backup or account login
- Usage stats and streak tracking
- Push/local notifications when timebox ends
- Siri suggestions for reflective flows
- AI-generated custom question packs

---

## Visual Design

**Tone:** Calm, intentional, friendly  
**Colors:** Soft neutrals, no harsh alerts  
**Fonts:** Rounded, legible, non-corporate  
**Animation:** Subtle countdown or wave during 60s delay

---

## Monetization

- MVP: free, no monetization
- Future ideas:
  - One-time purchase to unlock advanced features
  - Premium tier: analytics, question packs, more customizations

---

## Dependencies / Tools

- React Native (Expo)
- AsyncStorage / MMKV
- `Linking.openURL()` for app deep links
- iCloud Shortcuts (user-installed)
- (Optional later: Expo Push Notifications or Background Tasks)

---

## Success Metrics

- % of launches that complete the 60-second pause
- % of users who complete bypass instead of quitting
- Retention over 7/30 days
- Qualitative feedback on mindfulness + control

---

## Timeline Estimate

| Week | Milestone                                  |
|------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Core UI for dashboard, app config          |
| 2    | Reflection + bypass flow                   |
| 3    | Shortcut creation and linking (iOS)        |
| 4    | Polish + onboarding + testflight launch    |

---

## Notes

- This product avoids the "parental control" stigma and instead offers **self-directed behavioral change**.
- Success depends heavily on:
  - Simple onboarding
  - Frictionless setup for Shortcuts
  - Strong UX and tone
